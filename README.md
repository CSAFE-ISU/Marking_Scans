# Marking_Scans
The goal for this project is to be able to take the current CSAFE manually identified land engraved areas data and use that data to train a 3d convolutional neural network. Once the 3d convolutional neural network has been trained, we plan to use the model to automate the identification process of land engraved area scans.
